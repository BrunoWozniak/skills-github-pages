Captain. Yes, sir? Tell them we wish to board at once. With all due respect, the Ambassadors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately. Yes, yes, of course, as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to receive the Ambassador.

Wait! Wait. Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you. No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport is not going to be pleasant. The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this planet.

What is going on down there? We've lost the transmission, sir. Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir? Well, no, but I don't, Seal off the bridge. Yes sir. That won't be enough, sir. I want droidekas up here at once!!! We will not survive this. Close the blast doors!!! That will hold them.

Some kinda fight, mesa tinks. Do you think they have been taken to camps? More likely they were wiped out. Mesa no tink so. Do you know where they are, Jar Jar? When in trouble, Gungans go to sacred place. Mesa show you. C'mon, mesa show you. You Honor, Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

Hey, hey! Gimme a lift. Ja Ja! Usen da booba! Wat! Mesa no have a booba. Here, taken dis one. Ja Ja! Jump Ja Ja! Jump! Throw down your weapons. They win this round. We're hit Artoo! Wah. I'm tring to stop.
